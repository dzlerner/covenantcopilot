## How ChatGPT Will Now Format Responses

With the updated system prompt, ChatGPT will now provide structured markdown responses that render beautifully in the chat interface.

### Example 1: Fence Paint Color Question

**User**: "What paint colors are approved for fences?"

**AI Response (Markdown)**:
```markdown
**No, blue is not an approved fence color** for Highlands Ranch properties.

## Why Earth-Tone Colors Are Required

HRCA requires all fences to be painted in approved earth-tone colors to maintain neighborhood aesthetic consistency and property values.

## Approved Colors

• **Desert Sand** (`Sherwin Williams SW 6169`)
• **Balanced Beige** (`Sherwin Williams SW 7037`)  
• **Natural Linen** (`Sherwin Williams SW 9109`)
• **Accessible Beige** (`Sherwin Williams SW 7036`)

## Important Requirements

• Must use **exterior-grade paint**
• Requires **ARC approval** before any color changes
• Fence must be maintained in good condition

## Edge Cases

If your fence borders a commercial area or has unique circumstances, contact the ARC directly as exceptions may apply on a case-by-case basis.
