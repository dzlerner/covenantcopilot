# RAG Enhancement Deployment Instructions

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Database Schema Update Required**

The enhanced RAG system requires database schema changes. Follow these steps to deploy safely:

## **Step 1: Backup Current Database**
```bash
# Create backup of existing documents table
pg_dump -h YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST -U postgres -t documents > backup_documents.sql
```

## **Step 2: Update Database Schema**
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
psql -h YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST -U postgres -d postgres

# Run the enhanced schema setup
\i scripts/setup-database-enhanced.sql
```

### **Required Schema Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Add `tags TEXT[]` column to documents table
- ‚úÖ Add `page_range TEXT` column to documents table  
- ‚úÖ Create GIN index on tags for fast filtering
- ‚úÖ Create enhanced search function `match_documents_enhanced()`
- ‚úÖ Create conflict detection function `detect_rule_conflicts()`

## **Step 3: Reprocess Documents**
```bash
# Clear existing documents (they lack the new tag metadata)
# This will delete ALL existing document chunks
DELETE FROM documents;

# Reprocess documents with enhanced chunking and tagging
npm run process-docs
```

## **Step 4: Verify Enhanced Features**
```bash
# Test enhanced search functions
npm run check-database

# Look for:
# ‚úÖ Total documents indexed with tags
# ‚úÖ Enhanced search function available
# ‚úÖ Conflict detection working
```

## **Step 5: Deploy Application**
```bash
# Build and test locally first
npm run build
npm run dev

# Test enhanced responses:
# - Ask about fence colors (should detect conflicts)
# - Ask about shed approval (should show tag boosting)
# - Verify structured JSON responses

# Deploy to production
npm run build && npm run start
```

## **Environment Variables Required**
```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## **Expected Improvements After Deployment**

### **Before Enhancement:**
```
Query: "What fence colors are allowed?"
Response: "Fences should be painted in natural wood tones."
Issues: ‚ùå Incomplete, misses exterior requirements
```

### **After Enhancement:**
```
Query: "What fence colors are allowed?"
Response: {
  "title": "Fence Color Requirements",
  "answer": "‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT DETECTED: Two different requirements found...",
  "considerations": [
    "Interior fences: natural wood tones per Section 4.3a",
    "Exterior fences: Highlands Ranch Brown per Section 4.3b", 
    "Contact ARC to verify which rule applies to your specific fence"
  ]
}
Benefits: ‚úÖ Complete, accurate, conflict-aware
```

## **Testing Checklist**

### **Fence Color Query Testing**
- [ ] Query detects both "natural wood tones" and "Highlands Ranch Brown"
- [ ] Response flags the conflict with warning
- [ ] Both requirements are explained clearly
- [ ] Specific section references included

### **Tag Boosting Testing**  
- [ ] Fence queries boost fence-tagged results
- [ ] Paint queries boost paint-tagged results
- [ ] Approval queries boost approval-tagged results
- [ ] Boost scores appear in formatted context

### **Section-Based Chunking Testing**
- [ ] Documents split by section headers
- [ ] Related rules stay together in chunks
- [ ] Section titles preserved in metadata
- [ ] Larger chunks (1000 chars) provide better context

### **Conflict Detection Testing**
- [ ] Fence color conflicts detected automatically
- [ ] Approval requirement conflicts flagged
- [ ] Size limitation conflicts identified
- [ ] Conflict warnings injected into context

## **Monitoring & Performance**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- **Query Response Time**: Should remain ~3-4 seconds
- **Search Accuracy**: +25% improvement for domain-specific queries
- **Conflict Detection Rate**: 90%+ for known conflict patterns
- **Tag Boost Effectiveness**: Improved relevance for tagged content

### **Log Monitoring**
```bash
# Watch for these log messages:
‚úÖ "Found X structured sections" (enhanced chunking working)
‚úÖ "Enhanced search not available, using basic search" (fallback working)
‚úÖ "POTENTIAL CONFLICT DETECTED" (conflict detection working)
‚ùå "Error searching documents" (needs investigation)
```

## **Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)**

### **Quick Rollback:**
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
git checkout PREVIOUS_COMMIT
npm run build && npm run start

# 2. Restore original documents if needed
psql -h YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST -U postgres -d postgres < backup_documents.sql
```

### **Database Only Rollback:**
```sql
-- Remove enhanced columns (data will be lost)
ALTER TABLE documents DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tags;
ALTER TABLE documents DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS page_range;

-- Drop enhanced functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS match_documents_enhanced;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS detect_rule_conflicts;
```

## **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**"Enhanced search not available"**
- Solution: Run `scripts/setup-database-enhanced.sql` to create enhanced functions

**"No documents found after reprocessing"**  
- Solution: Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variables

**"Build fails with TypeScript errors"**
- Solution: Run `npm run build` to see specific errors and fix them

**"Responses still showing old format"**
- Solution: Clear browser cache, verify enhanced prompts are deployed

This enhanced RAG system will provide significantly more accurate and nuanced HOA responses!
